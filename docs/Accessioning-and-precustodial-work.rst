==================================
Accessioning and Precustodial Work
==================================

Precustodial work is all work that occurs before a collection is formally transferred 
to the Rose Library. It includes the packing, shipping, and receiving of material, as 
well as managing the paperwork required to formally transfer a collection or item. 
Collection Services staff should be prepared to work with donors, vendors, and 
curators to provide guidance on any precustodial actions taken by the Library. 

.. _Consultation-with-donors:

-----------------------------
1.1 Consultations with donors
-----------------------------

Prior to a collection being acquired by the Rose Library, The Head of Collection 
Services may consult with curators to draft an `Operational Impact Statement 
<https://emory.box.com/s/btfvoh8gltpob8ynj8uhe3r7348pr455>`_ to assess the overall 
space and supply needs of a collection, as well as cost of transfer, accessioning, 
processing, and storing a collection.  

Additionally, collection services staff may meet with donors or curators to provide 
guidance and assistance on matters such as: 

*	Packing and shipping
*	Transfer of of born-digital material (see forms and procedures `here 	
	<https://emory.box.com/s/ykvtm447e8e3b92gb7kvmqe84o3xugtf>`_) 
*	Appraisal
*	Arrangement and description
*	Conservation

.. _Collections-receiving:

--------------------------
1.2 Collections receiving 
--------------------------

Collections receiving is the physical transfer of collection material from a donor, 
individual seller, or vendor to the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, & Rare Book 
Library. The primary point of contact for collections receiving for Emory University 
Archives at the Rose Library is the University Archivist. The primary point of 
contact for collections receiving for all other units at the Rose Library is the 
Accessioning & Collections Manager.

.. _Receipt-of-new-or-potential-acquisitions:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.2.4 Receipt of New or Potential Acquisitions 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All collection material should be received and opened/unpacked by the Accessioning 
and Collections Manager. 

Small packages will be delivered to the Rose Library mailroom.  Larger packages or 
collections will be delivered to the main Woodruff mailroom.  The main Woodruff 
mailroom on Level 2 is not a secure space and collection material should be moved to 
a secure holdings location as soon as possible upon arrival. 

**New Acquisition Storage:**

Acquisitions that measure 10 linear feet or fewer will be unpacked and stored on the 
new acquisition storage shelves on Level 9, given space. Larger acquisitions will be 
moved to additional holding spaces on Level 9 or 11. Hard drives storing born digital 
collection material should be securely stored in the Digital Archives lab while 
awaiting accessioning. In some circumstances, material may be received at the Library 
Service Center (LSC).  All new acquisitions should be labelled with the collection 
title, date of receipt, and temporary box number upon receipt.  The Accessioning and 
Collections Manager will log all new acquisitions in the pending acquisitions tab on 
the Master Shelf List. 

Upon receipt of a collection the Accessioning and Collections Manager will:  

*	Open and unpack the collection
*	Add material to either the `Gift or Purchase Acquisitions Log 
	<https://emory.app.box.com/folder/2493112313>`_ as appropriate
*	Place the items and any accompanying documentation onto the appropriate shelf for 
	curatorial review 
*	Alert the Curator that material is ready to be reviewed (Curator will make final 
	decision on whether to move forward with the acquisition)
	
If the curator decides to not move forward with an acquisition, it is the curator's 
responsibility to notify the donor/seller. The Accessioning and Collections Manager 
can help coordinate return of the material, once the donor/seller has been notified 
by the curator. 

.. _Paperwork:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.2.5 Paperwork
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No collection material may be cataloged or accessioned until the appropriate 
paperwork has been received. All paperwork should be transferred to the Accessioning 
and Collections Manager.  

**Managing Paperwork in Box**

Rose staff stores and manages all acquisitions-related paperwork on Box.  Box allows 
staff to access shared folders and communicate with one another inside the 
application, creating and maintaining a record of communications for each 
acquisition.  

There are two Box folders that we use to manage this process-the Rose Library 
Purchase Payments folder and the Rose Library Gift in Kind process folder.  Each of 
these folders is subdivided by step in the acquisition process and then by major 
collecting area.  As new collections move through the acquisitions process, the 
Accessioning and Collections Manager will update the files and move the paperwork 
into a folder associated with the next stage of the process.  As paperwork moves 
through the process, the Accessioning and Collections Manager will use the tagging 
and task list functions in Box to update Rose Library and LITS staff members about 
the status of the acquisition or to alert someone when an action is required. 

**Paperwork Required for Purchase Payment**

The Rose Library requires the following forms for purchases: 

*	Invoice (Collections Manager will generate an invoice to accompany a Deed of Sale)
*	Payment Request Form (PRF)
*	Deed of Sale (for purchases from private individuals)
*	Domestic Vendors: Supplier/Individual Information Form (SIIF) and an ACH Payment 
	Authorization Form (ACH)
*	International Vendors: W-8BEN-E (businesses)/W-8BEN (individuals) and Foreign 
	Wire Transfer Form
*	Vendor Forms are required when: 

	*	The seller is new
	*	The Rose Library has not purchased from the seller within the last 14 months
	*	The seller's information (including address) has changed since we last 
		purchased material from them
		
**Managing Purchase Paperwork in Box**

The Rose Library manages purchase paperwork on Box through the Rose Library Purchases 
Payments Folder.  This folder is organized into subfolders by process step and then 
by collecting area.   

*	**Step 1:** Received and Pending
	
	*	Curators or Accessioning and Collection Manager upload preliminary paperwork 
		for prospective acquisitions such as invoices, One-Pagers, or Appraisal 
		reports to this folder.    
	*	Accessioning and Collection Manager either confirms that a seller is an 
		active vendor with the University or new vendors and sellers to obtain vendor 
		paperwork. 
	*	Accessioning and Collection Manager confirms that all required paperwork has 
		been submitted and combines the vital documents into one file.  Vital 
		documents include the invoice, the Deed of Sale, vendor documents, if 
		applicable, and the PRF. 
	*	File titles should be structured to include the vendor name, invoice number 
		and fiscal year. For example: "Vendor or Seller Name_Invoice Number_Fiscal 
		Year," such as "John Doe Bookseller_123456_FY17." 
	*	Once all paperwork is submitted, the file moves to step 2.
	
*	**Step 2:** Submitted PRFs
	
	*	Accessioning and Collection Manager tags the Associate Director and Director 
		to approve the disbursement of funds.  
	*	Director or Associate Director will approve in the Box comment section.
	*	Once the purchase has been approved, the file moves to step 3.
	
*	**Step 3:** Verified

	*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager tags the Administrative Assistant 
		for submission to ServiceNow.
	*	The Administrative Assistant submits the paperwork for payment via ServiceNow.
	*	The Administrative Assistant leaves a Box comment indicating the submission 
		of the payment along with the REQ number associated with the ServiceNow 
		request.
	*	Once the paperwork has been submitted to ServiceNow: 
		
		*	The Accessioning and Collection Manager tags the Budget Analyst and the 
			Senior Accounting Assistant in LITS Finance to alert them for their 
			tracking purposes.
		*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager tags the accessioning team on 
			purchases including manuscript material to alert them that the material 
			can now be accessioned. 
			
At the end of each fiscal year, the Accessioning and Collections Manager moves all 
completed paperwork in the Step 3 folder for purchases into a new subfolder titled 
"FY--" (e.g., FY16).

**Paperwork Required for Gifts in Kind**

The following paperwork is required to process and accession gifts: 

*	Signed Gift in Kind Form (required for all gifts)
*	Deed of Gift (required for manuscript collections that a donor or appraiser 
	values over $5000, or collections with any terms, conditions, or restrictions 
	imposed by the donor)
	
**NOTE:** For gifts containing only books, the Rose Library only requires a Gift-in-Kind 
Contribution Form in order to proceed with cataloging, but Emory's department of 
Development and Alumni Relations (DAR) may require additional paperwork and an 
appraisal, depending on the value that the donor places on the gift. In this case it 
is DAR's responsibility to pursue documentation beyond the Gift in Kind form.

**Managing Gift Paperwork in Box**

The Rose Library manages gift paperwork on Box through the Rose Library Gift in Kind 
Process folder. This folder is organized into subfolders by process step and then by 
collecting area.  The Accessioning and Collections Manager is responsible for 
combining paperwork into a single PDF file, moving that file between the Box folders, 
and tagging appropriate parties for next steps.

*	**Step 1:** Gifts Received by Collections Manager 

	*	Curators or Accessioning and Collections Manager upload preliminary paperwork 
		for prospective acquisitions.  This could include one pagers, appraisal 
		reports, or Box Notes detailing conversations and negotiations with donors. 
	*	Curators are responsible for procuring the appropriate paperwork from donors.
	*	All files should follow the naming convention:  "Donor Name_Calendar Year 
		Received," such as "John Doe_2016."
	*	Once an acquisition has a completed Gift in Kind form, and, if necessary, a 
		Deed of Gift, the Accessioning and Collections Manager moves the paperwork to 
		the *Gifts Ready for Acknowledgement by Rose Director* folder.
		
*	**Step 2:** Gifts Ready for Acknowledgement by Rose Director

	*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager notifies the Administrative 
		Assistant with a Box tag.
	*	The Administrative Assistant drafts an acknowledgement letter and facilitates 
		getting it signed by the Director.
	*	The Administrative Assistant sends the acknowledgement letter and leaves a 
		note in Box with this information. 
	*	At that point, the Accessioning and Collections Manager moves the 
		documentation to *Gifts Ready for DAR Acknowledgement* folder.
		
*	**Step 3:** Gifts Ready for DAR Acknowledgment

	*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager tags the Director and Assistant 
		Director of Development for the Libraries on Box.
	*	DAR will acknowledge the gift and file a copy of the Gift in Kind in their 
		records.
		
At the end of the calendar year, the Accessioning and Collections Manager moves all 
completed paperwork in the Step 3 folder for gifts into a new subfolder for the 
calendar year.

Unsolicited gifts are documented in the Step 1: Gifts Received by Collections 
Manager, usually with a Boxnote, but may be represented with a letter, or other 
documentation from the donor. When creating a Boxnote for an unsolicited gift, 
include contact information for the donor, the contents of the gift, the physical 
size of the gift, and the date of arrival. The Administrative Assistant is 
responsible for  following up with the donor to obtain proper paperwork. 

.. _Financial-appraisal:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.2.6 Financial Appraisal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collections may be appraised in two circumstances, if a donor would like to take a 
tax write off on a gift or if curators need a professional evaluation to determine a 
fair purchase price for a prospective acquisition.   It is the donor's responsibility 
to arrange appraisals for tax purposes.

Collection Services staff may occasionally be called on to assist in coordinating and 
facilitating financial appraisals of Rose Library collections or potential 
acquisitions.  While we can facilitate the work of professional appraisers, Rose 
Library staff cannot provide or estimate a value for any special collections material 
per the `ACRL Code of Ethics for Special Collections Librarians 
<http://rbms.info/standards/code_of_ethics/>`_, nor can we provide any tax advice to 
donors.  

If a curator or administrator chooses to engage an appraiser, they must schedule the 
appointment with the appraiser and contact the Accessioning and Collections Manager 
or Head of Collection Services as early as possible.

Once an appraisal is scheduled, the Accessioning and Collections Manager will: 

*	Reserve the Folio Room for the appointment  
*	Notify Research Services staff
*	Move the material to the Collections Transition Room (CTR) in advance of the visit
*	Return material to its holding location when the appraisal is concluded

Invoices for an appraiser's services should be directed to the Administrative 
Assistant. Appraisal reports prepared for collection material we are acquiring should 
be provided to the Accessioning and Collections Manager, who will post them to Box 
for everyone's access. 

**NOTE:** this is the only instance when unaccessioned and uncataloged material 
should be stored in the CTR and/or made available in the Reading Room. Collection 
Services is not responsible for assisting the appraiser with any billing or travel 
issues; those inquiries should be directed to the Rose Administrative Assistant.

.. _Accessioning:

-----------------
1.3 Accessioning
-----------------

Accessioning is the formal act of taking legal and physical control of an archival or 
manuscript collection. Formally accessioning material helps to establish the 
authenticity of the material through documenting chain of custody. It also gives the 
Rose Library administrative and custodial control over collections and shows that the 
library is acting in good faith when accepting archival material by documenting the 
transfer and its terms. 

The Rose Library aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers 
immediately following accessioning. Therefore, accessioning new material requires 
sufficient description to make the collection discoverable and usable. Material must 
be described at minimum at the box level, but other descriptive information may be 
limited. Detailed processing is not common at this time, though may be warranted 
(e.g. the collection is quite small, researcher need is high). 

Determine the appropriate :ref:`level of processing<>` at the time of accessioning 
and then move forward with creating the descriptive documents.

.. _Managing-accessioning-workflow:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.3.1 Managing Accessioning Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When material has been either acknowledged or paid for and is ready to be accessioned 
the Accessioning and Collections Manager will share this information with the 
accessioning team. 

*	When new acquisitions are ready to be accessioned, the Accessioning and 
	Collections Manager tags the accessioning team in Box.
*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager maintains a whiteboard with all new 
	manuscript acquisitions and marks the ones that are ready for discussion at the 
	weekly accessioning meeting.
*	During this meeting, the Accessioning and Collections Manager updates the team on 
	the status of pending collections and gives information on any significant, new 
	collections that have entered the acquisitions process.
*	The accessioning team members add collections to their individual accessioning 
	queues based on current workloads and specific expertise.
*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager distributes original paperwork for the 
	new assignments.

.. _Creation-of-the-accession-record:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.3.2 Creation of the Accession Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system of record for accession information is the Accessions Database located on 
the F: Drive at  ``F:/MARBL/Accession Database/Manuscript Accessions.mbd``  All new 
collection material receives a record in this database upon receipt. 

**Navigating the Database and Using Microsoft Access**

To create the accession record, from the main menu of the accession database select 
"Edit Existing Records." At the next menu choose "Edit Accession Records." This will 
open the database to the first record. At the bottom of the page, click the double 
arrow, which will progress the database to the last record. Make note of the 
accession number on the last record.

To add a new record, click "Add Record" at the bottom of the page, and a blank form 
will open. 

**Populating the Accesssion Record**

Below is a sample record in the accessions database.  The record should be as fully 
fleshed out as you are able to make it with the information available to you.  Not 
all fields are required for each new accession, but it is the intent to capture as 
much information about the collection and its transfer as you can at this stage.

|*Extent:*            | Record the extent of the material, using linear footage when |
|                     | possible. Many new accessions will be single items added to  |
|                     | existing collections, in which case number of items can be   |
|                     | used for extent.                                             |

|*Brief Description   |	The Brief Description of Materials field should include a of | 
|Materials:*          | description of the creator and a clear description of the    |
|                     | materials. Specific language is used in this field to        |
|                     | indicate whether the acquisition is a new collection or an   |
|                     | addition to an existing collection.                          |
|                     |                                                              |

|                     | important that we be able to track which items came from     |
|                     | which sources.  In miscellany collections or instances where |
|                     | the addition is very small (a few files), write the accession|

|                     | collection and note the Box and Folder number in the Brief   |

|                     | For large additions, note the box numbers in the field and   |
|                     | add the new custodial history information to the note in the |
|                     | finding aid [LINK].                                          |
